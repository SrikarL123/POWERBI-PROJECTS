ðŸ“Š **SN Corp Sales Performance â€“ Power BI Dashboard**

ðŸ”¹ **Problem It Solves**

Businesses like SN Corp. handle extensive sales data across various products, countries, and customers. Manually sifting through this information to find meaningful patterns is often:

* **Inefficient** â€“ Taking hours or days to analyze spreadsheets for performance reports.
* **Unclear** â€“ Making it difficult to spot which products are most profitable or which regions are underperforming.
* **Slow** â€“ Delaying critical business decisions that rely on up-to-date sales intelligence.

This dashboard solves this by consolidating complex sales data into an interactive, visual format, providing immediate and actionable insights.
