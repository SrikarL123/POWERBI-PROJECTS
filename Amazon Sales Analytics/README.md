ðŸ“Š Amazon Sales Analytics â€“ Power BI Dashboard

ðŸ”¹ Problem It Solves

Businesses often deal with 'large, unstructured sales data' spread across products, categories, 
time periods, and regions. Manually analyzing this data can be:

* Time-consuming â€“ filtering through thousands of orders.
* Confusing â€“ hard to spot trends and profitable categories.
* Inefficient â€“ decision-making suffers without quick insights.

This dashboard solves that problem by transforming raw Amazon sales data into 'actionable insights'.

ðŸ”¹ Key Insights from the Dashboard

* Sales & Profit KPIs â†’ Track total orders, revenue, and profitability at a glance.
* Sales Trends Over Time â†’ Identify seasonal peaks, promotional impacts, or sales drops.
* Category Analysis â†’ See which product categories (e.g., Chairs, Phones, Tables) generate the highest sales.
* Regional Profitability â†’ Find which states drive the most profit (e.g., California dominates).
* Performance vs Target â†’ Compare actual sales against a benchmark/target.

ðŸ”¹ Why Itâ€™s Useful

This visualization enables:

* Business managers to make data-driven decisions.
* Marketing teams to focus on profitable products/regions.
* Inventory teams to forecast demand more accurately.
* Executives to quickly monitor company performance without going through raw data.
