ðŸ“Š HR Analytics for Attrition â€“ Power BI Dashboard

ðŸ”¹ **Problem It Solves**

Companies frequently struggle with employee turnover (attrition), which leads to high recruitment costs, loss of knowledge, and reduced productivity. Understanding *why* and *where* attrition is happening from raw HR data is often:

* **Complex** â€“ Data is spread across employee profiles, departments, and roles.
* **Time-Consuming** â€“ Manually identifying trends in spreadsheets is slow and inefficient.
* **Reactive** â€“ Without clear insights, management can only react to turnover, not prevent it.

This dashboard solves these issues by transforming complex employee data into a clear, interactive visual summary, enabling proactive and data-driven retention strategies.

ðŸ”¹ **Key Insights from the Dashboard**

* **Attrition KPIs** â†’ Instantly view key metrics like total employees, the number of attritions, and the overall attrition rate (e.g., 15.7% in the R&D department).
* **High-Risk Roles** â†’ The "Sum of Attrition by Job Role" chart clearly identifies the specific roles with the highest turnover, such as Sales Executive and Research Scientist.
* **Departmental Hotspots** â†’ The dashboard allows filtering by department (Sales, R&D, HR), revealing which parts of the business are most affected. For example, the attrition rate in HR (30.2%) is nearly double that of R&D (15.7%).
* **Demographic Analysis** â†’ Understand attrition patterns across different age groups, genders, and educational backgrounds to spot underlying trends.
* **Tenure Insights** â†’ The "Average Years worked in Company" metric helps quantify the experience level being lost.

ðŸ”¹ **Why Itâ€™s Useful**

This visualization empowers different stakeholders to take targeted action:

* **HR Managers** can identify the root causes of turnover and develop focused retention programs.
* **Department Heads** can monitor the health of their teams and address role-specific issues.
* **Executives** can get a high-level overview of workforce stability and its financial impact.
* **Recruitment Teams** can anticipate hiring needs for high-turnover positions.
