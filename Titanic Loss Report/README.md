 **Problem It Solves**

The Titanic passenger manifest is a rich but complex dataset. Manually analyzing this raw data to understand the factors influencing survival is:

* **Difficult** â€“ It's hard to spot correlations between demographics (like age and gender) and outcomes from rows of data.
* **Time-Consuming** â€“ Calculating and comparing survival rates across different passenger classes and embarkation points requires significant manual effort.
* **Abstract** â€“ Numbers in a table don't convey the human story or the stark realities of the disaster as effectively as visuals.

This dashboard solves these issues by transforming the historical data into an accessible visual analysis, allowing for the quick identification of key factors that determined passenger survival.

 **Key Insights from the Dashboard**

* **Gender and Survival** â†’ Gender was a primary factor in survival. [cite_start]A large majority of males did not survive, whereas a significantly higher number of females did[cite: 2, 3, 4, 5].
* **Age and Survival** â†’ The 20-29 age group had the highest number of casualties. [cite_start]Children (age 0-9), however, had a higher survival rate within their group[cite: 6, 27, 29, 31].
* **Passenger Class and Survival** â†’ Survival was strongly linked to socio-economic status. [cite_start]First-class passengers had a much higher rate of survival, while third-class passengers fared the worst[cite: 13, 14, 47, 48, 49].
* **Embarkation Points** â†’ Most passengers (79.08%) embarked from Southampton. [cite_start]This port also accounted for the largest portion of the total fare collected (61.85%)[cite: 18, 23, 32, 43].

 **Why Itâ€™s Useful**

This visualization serves several purposes:

* **For Historians and Researchers:** It provides a quick, interactive way to explore demographic patterns and correlations within the passenger data.
* **For Data Science Students:** It is a classic example of how to use data visualization to find and communicate insights from a well-known historical dataset.
* **For the General Public:** It makes the statistics of the tragedy more understandable and highlights the clear disparities in survival rates among different groups.
